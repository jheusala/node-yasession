Yet another session implementation for Node.js
==============================================

Description
-----------

This is a yet another session implementation for Node.js.

I know that there's a lot of Session modules for Node.js but I failed to find 
one like [Cookies](https://github.com/jed/cookies/) that was keep-it-simple and 
standalone.

Currently the module saves sessions to the filesystem but that should be 
changed to use some kind of plugable storing method.

Installation
------------

Simplest way to install is to use [npm](http://npmjs.org/), just simply `npm install yasession`.
